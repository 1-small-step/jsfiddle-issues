   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to jsFiddle's documentation!
====================================

*JsFiddle is a playground for web developers, a tool which may be used in many 
ways. One can use it as an online editor for snippets build from HTML, CSS 
and JavaScript. The code can then be shared with others, embedded on a blog, 
etc. Using this approach, JavaScript developers can very easily isolate bugs. 
We aim to support all actively developed frameworks - it helps with testing 
compatibility.* [Interview]_
