# JSFiddle Issues

## Important:

This repo is for issues for the current version of JSFiddle (0.5). Some reported bugs/improvements/features will never be implemented in this old version, **hence will be closed**. 

The future version of JSFiddle (currently being worked on), will have a completely different place to report issues.
