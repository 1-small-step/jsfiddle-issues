## Important note on existing issues:

Known and minor issues will **not be addressed and most likely will be closed** - this repo is for issues for the current version of JSFiddle. Some reported bugs/improvements/features will never be implemented in this old version.

The future version of JSFiddle (currently being worked on), will have a completely different place to report issues.

## Public Roadmap:

Our public roadmap is available here: **https://trello.com/b/LakLkQBW/jsfiddle-roadmap**
