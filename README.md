# JSFiddle Issues

[![Gitter](https://badges.gitter.im/jsfiddle/jsfiddle-issues.svg)](https://gitter.im/jsfiddle/jsfiddle-issues?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge)

## Important:

This repo is for issues for the current version of JSFiddle (0.5). Some reported bugs/improvements/features will never be implemented in this old version, hence will be closed. 

The future version of JSFiddle (currently being worked on), will have a completely different place to report issues.
