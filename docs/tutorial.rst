Tutorial

From the start, jsFiddle was built to be simple and intuitive to use.

This tutorial aims to help you write your first "Hello World" Fiddle.

First Fiddle : "Hello World - Goodbye World"
--------------------------------------------

We are going to build a simple Hello World example in jsFiddle. It will
create a box that shows "Hello World!". We will also add a MooTools click
event that means when we click on the box, it change to say "Goodbye
World!" and fade out.

Open up jsFiddle
""""""""""""""""

First things first, open up `jsFiddle <http://jsfiddle.net/>`_ in a browser
window and put it somewhere you can easily switch between this tutorial and
that screen.

You will be greeted by the blank jsFiddle screen shown left, ready for your
beautiful creation.

You will see that there are four panes - three are for editing HTML, CSS
and JavaScript, we will enter code into each of these during the tutorial.

The final pane "Result" is where jsFiddle creates a page from our code -
our Hello World will appear here.

At the top of the screen are buttons for managing the Fiddle, and on the
left hand side are more detailed settings for the Fiddle. You won't need to
look at these now - they are addressed in the Advanced Usage section.

Create the Hello World HTML
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Add some style, make it a box
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Add the javascript, make it clickable
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Well done
"""""""""

Under the hood
--------------

The JS, CSS and HTML you write into the three editor panes are assembled to
create the Result pane. jsFiddle does some clever stuff to ensure that the
code entered is safe, and then returns the result:

[CODE BREAKDOWN]

Next steps

You're ready to jump off into the world of jsFiddle.
