Tutorial

From the start, jsFiddle was built to be simple and intuitive to use. This
tutorial aims to help you write your first "Hello World" Fiddle.

A first Example
---------------

Often the quickest way to learn is by looking at examples and experimenting
with the system. Start by opening up `Simple MooTools Delay
<http://jsfiddle.net/zalun/NmudS/>`_

Watch as it runs and the test box in the Result pane disappears.


Your Hello World
----------------




Under the hood
--------------

The JS, CSS and HTML you write into the three editor panes are assembled to
create the Result pane. jsFiddle does some clever stuff to ensure that the code
entered is safe, and then returns the result:

[CODE BREAKDOWN]

Next steps
----------

You're ready to jump off into the world of jsFiddle.

Now is a good time to look at some more complex examples and start
experimenting.
